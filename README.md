### 🏗️ What I'm Working On

- **Alpen Labs**:
    - 🦀💻 Contributing to [Strata/Alpen](https://github.com/alpenlabs/alpen), a Bitcoin-native rollup with a 1/n bridge security model (BitVM/Glock25). Working across the stack; Sequencer internals, DA and ZK proof statements.

### 🗂️ Notable Work

- **EIP-7503: Zero-Knowledge Wormholes**
  - 🕶️ An Ethereum Improvement Proposal for native private ETH transfers using zero-knowledge proofs, built on top of a private proof of burn mechanism. The protocol enables users to burn ETH and re-mint it to a new address without any on-chain link, providing plausible deniability at the protocol level. [EIP7503](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7503)

- **Private Proof of Solvency**
  - 🕵️‍♂️ Designed a privacy-preserving proof of solvency protocol, enabling custody providers to prove their reserves in public without exposing sensitive financial data with using zkp. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13900)

- **ZkSync-Based Bitcoin Validium**
  - 🦀💻 A Layer 2 validium solution on Bitcoin at **txFusion**, drawing inspiration from zkSync Era. Focused on MuSig2, Bitcoin inscription envelopes, and the zkSync Era sequencer architecture, serving as Protocol Architect and Rust Engineer. [Repo](https://github.com/vianetwork/via-core)

- **Ethereum Protocol Fellowship**
  - 🕸️ Implemented [Inclusion Lists with Plausible Deniability](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-five/blob/main/projects/attestation-based-inclusion-list.md) on **Reth** and **Lighthouse**.
  - ⚙️ Built a [direct (non-HTTP) integration](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-five/blob/main/projects/direct-integration-of-lighthouse-reth-and-tracing-integration-in-lighthouse.md) of Lighthouse-Reth.

- **Enterprise Wallet Systems**
  - 💼 3 years building high-scale exchange infrastructure. Built systems that managed millions of addresses, with a focus on on-chain privacy, key security (MPC, HSM), and smart contract-based asset management on EVM chains.


- **On-Chain Order Book DEX**
  - 🎯 Contributed to a decentralized exchange with a fully on-chain order book using sum trees for efficient matching. [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.multipool.finance/protocol-overview/independent-on-chain-order-book/sum-trees)
